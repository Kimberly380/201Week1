  <h1>Here's a few questions for you!</h1>
  <p> Question 1: Let's start easy. What's your name?</p>
  <p> Question 2: Don't lie now! How old are you? </p>
  <p> Question 3: And where are you from?</p>
  <p> Question 4: Very important if we want to be friends - Do you prefer dogs or cats?</p>
  <p> Question 5: Also important if we want to hang out - Do you prefer wine or beer?</p>
  <p> Question 6: Next let's decide what to binge watch. What's your favorite TV show?</p>
  <p> Question 7: And just because I'm curious (and want to use numbers again) - How many years have you lived in Portland?</p>
